ðŸ“‹ Code Review Standards
1. General Guidelines

Reviews must be completed before merging any pull request (PR).

At least one peer review (preferably two for critical code).

No direct commits to the main/master branch.

Focus on code quality, readability, security, and maintainabilityâ€”not personal style preferences.

Be constructive: suggest improvements instead of just pointing out issues.

2. Code Quality & Readability

âœ… Follow coding standards (Java: Google Style, Python: PEP8, JavaScript: ESLint/Prettier, etc.).
âœ… Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, and files.
âœ… Keep functions small, single-purpose, and modular.
âœ… Avoid code duplicationâ€”extract reusable components or methods.
âœ… Ensure proper comments and documentation (only where logic is non-trivial).
âœ… Check for consistent indentation, spacing, and formatting.
âœ… Ensure logs are meaningful and not excessive.

3. Functionality & Correctness

âœ… Code should meet the requirements of the ticket/user story.
âœ… Validate input/output correctness and error handling.
âœ… Confirm edge cases and boundary conditions are handled.
âœ… Unit tests must be included/updated for new functionality.
âœ… Automated tests should pass locally & in CI/CD pipelines.

4. Security & Reliability

âœ… No hardcoded secrets, passwords, or tokens.
âœ… Validate input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
âœ… Ensure secure API calls (e.g., HTTPS, auth checks).
âœ… Avoid using deprecated libraries or methods.
âœ… Validate exception handling (no silent failures).

5. Performance & Scalability

âœ… Avoid unnecessary loops, nested iterations, or heavy computations.
âœ… Use efficient data structures and algorithms.
âœ… Minimize API/database callsâ€”batch or cache when possible.
âœ… Ensure code does not introduce memory leaks or excessive resource usage.

6. Testing Standards

âœ… Unit tests must cover at least 70â€“80% of new code.
âœ… Write integration tests for critical features.
âœ… Ensure test names are descriptive and meaningful.
âœ… Avoid brittle/flaky tests.
âœ… Mock dependencies in unit tests.

7. CI/CD & Deployment

âœ… Code must pass all linting, formatting, and static analysis checks.
âœ… All tests must pass in the pipeline before merging.
âœ… PR should be linked to Jira/GitHub issue ID.
âœ… Reviewers should verify build artifacts & deployment scripts.

8. Pull Request (PR) Best Practices

PR title should be clear & descriptive (e.g., Fix: API timeout issue in Auth Service).

Keep PRs small and focused (large PRs are harder to review).

PR description should include:

What was changed

Why it was changed

How it was tested

Reviewers must check for merge conflicts before approval.

9. Reviewer Responsibilities

Ask questions instead of making assumptions.

Suggest alternatives with examples when possible.

Approve only when all issues are addressed.

Use labels (LGTM, Needs Changes, Minor Suggestion) consistently.

10. Author Responsibilities

Self-review before submitting a PR.

Provide adequate documentation & comments.

Respond promptly to review comments.

Donâ€™t merge until all reviewers approve.

Keep PRs up-to-date with the base branch.
